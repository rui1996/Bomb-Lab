# Bomb-Lab
A very classic and interesting lab of CSAPP which requires your reverse engineering skills.
    As part of the course Introduction to Computer Science, we are originally required to do this lab on the school's linux server 
and the process is very excited since the bomb may explode if you forget to set a breakpoint or type in a 'c'.
    Everyone's bomb is different and this is only my version. You can disassemble the files to read the assembly language version of 
the functions and decide to type in the answer.
    There are six phases and one secret phase.
    Hope you enjoy it.
